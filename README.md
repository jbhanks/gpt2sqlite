Script to extract ChatGPT logs from the json generated by backing up my data and put them into a sqlite database.

Usage: `sh json2sqlite.sh /path/to/OpenAI/conversations.json /path/to/create/database.sqlite`


# How to get your logs:

In ChatGPT webUI, go to Settings > Data controls > Export data anc click "export", then check your email for a link to your data. When you dowload and unzip it, it should contain a `conversations.json` file.


### Requirements:
* jq
* sqlite
* python (not sure of minimum version, but definitely 3.x)
* sqlite-utils (Python package, install using `pip`)

And preferably an sqlite browser to view your data.
